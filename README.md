Chloropleth Map of US Airports write up a project description in the readme.md file. This file will introduce the project name, a brief introduction, the major functions (especially the function which was not covered in the lectures), libraries, data sources, credit, acknowledgement, and other necessary information This chloropleth map of all US Airports was created for OSU GEOG572 Geovisual Analytics. The map shows all airports in the US, color-coded by whether or not they have a control tower. States are further color-coded on a sequential color pallete, representing the density (number) of airports in the state. A firey ocean reminds the site's visitor that on one hand, planes are able to cross desolate, violent, unforgiving bodies of water from the comfort, convenience, and speed of air travel; while on the other hand, is a reminder about the consequences of things gone wrong. Hotplate States filled with warm colors suggests safety does not even necessarily offer promise on land. A warning should appear when the user loads the page, to remind about Alaska and Hawaii, which have respectable airport densities. The warning can be closed, which will bring the legend and credit box into screen view. Airport data has been used from Data.gov by allowance of the United States Government. Mike Bostock (of D3) has provided data of state boundaries. Map baselayers and user-interactive features are from Leaflet. Other sources include Google Font Library and ColorBrewer2.org.
